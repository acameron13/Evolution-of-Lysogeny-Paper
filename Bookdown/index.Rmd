## Research Overview

### Abstract
Bacteriophages, viruses that target bacteria, are found everywhere in nature. Phages play vital roles in their microbiomes as a result of selective pressure that they place on their hosts. As obligate symbionts, phages depend on bacteria for successful reproduction, and either destroy their hosts through lysis or potentially increase host fitness through lysogeny. Lysis involves reproduction within the host membrane and the eventual bursting of the cell to release their progeny. Alternatively, lysogeny is the process by which phage DNA is inserted into the host DNA, and thus the phage reproduces when their host reproduces. As such, phages exist along the parasitism-mutualism spectrum, prompting the questions of how and why phage would evolve one reproductive strategy over the other. In our agent-based model, we found that a viral population with beneficial lysogenic phage can select against lytic strategies. This result has important implications for bottom-up control of various ecosystems.


### Experiments
The following chapters of this book represent the main experiments conducted for our research. We implemented two features of focus: induction into the lytic cycle and the impact that a prophage can have on host metabolism. The first two experiments explore these features independently of one another (Chapter 4 being host metabolism impact only without induction and Chapter 5 being induction without any impact on host metabolism). The next two chapters investigate the impact of both of these features on the co-evolution of viruses and bacteria. Chapter 7 shows the data for the maintaining of harmful/neutral/beneficial phage populations by starting with fixed populations, while Chapter 8 shows the data for the de novo evolution of harmful/neutral/beneficial phage by starting with random populations. Our primary findings are shown in Chapter 7.

### Results
Our results show that even in conditions that would typically select for a lytic phage population, the potential for prophage to have a positive impact on host metabolism leads to the evolution on more temperate populations. This result is primarily shown in the mean chance of lysis plot in Chapter 7. This result has important implications for the construction of microbiomes and thus ecosystems in general.
